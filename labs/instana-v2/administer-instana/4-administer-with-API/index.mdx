# Administer Instana with API's


In this section of the lab we will create an API Token that will be used for executing the Instana Rest API calls. The Instana web REST API allows for retrieval of data such as traces and metrics, as well as configuration, such as service extraction and user management.
In order to use the web REST API, you need to create an API token and assign permissions.


From the Bastion host open the Firefox browser and select the **Instana**
bookmark.
