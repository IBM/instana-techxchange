# Introduction

In this TechXchange lab, you will be going through several key exercises that will help you learn more about using OpenTelemetry tracing with IBM Instana. You will cover topics such as:

- Configuring Instana Agent by enabling OpenTelemetry settings
- Exploring Instana UI for the OpenTelemetry tracing data
- Exploring merged OpenTelemetry and the native tracing data
- Acquiring OpenTelemetry Logs content from the OpenTelemetry Collector
- ... and much more!

The lab should be executed in the numbered order that you see on the left side of the screen in the navigation pane as sections likely depend on work completed in prior sections.
