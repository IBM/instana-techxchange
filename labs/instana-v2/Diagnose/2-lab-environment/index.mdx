# Lab Architecture
This lab consists of several virtual machines that are setup with the software necessary to execute the lab. 
The virtual machines can be seen below. 

The virtual machines are:
# • 2021-001-bastion: 
This is the Bastion node for the OpenShift cluster. In the lab guide, we will refer to it as the “Bastion Node”

# • 2021-001-infranfs: 
This is the Infrastructure node for the OpenShift cluster. It provides NFS filesystems for the OpenShift storage and is running an haproxy. 
All traffic into the OpenShift cluster flows through the haproxy. In addition, we have an IBM MQ and IBM App Connect Enterprise server running on this virtual machine. In the lab guide, we will refer to this node as the “Infrastructure Node”.

# • 2021-001-student:
 This is the primary VM that you will be using to access the Instana user interface, run commands from a terminal window, etc. You will
 access the other VMs via ssh. In the lab guide, we will refer to this node as the “student VM”

# • 2021-001-kubernetes: 
This virtual machine is a single node Kubernetes cluster. We have ac ouple of different applications installed into the Kubernetes cluster. 
In the lab guide, we will refer to this virtual machine as the “Kubernetes” node.
