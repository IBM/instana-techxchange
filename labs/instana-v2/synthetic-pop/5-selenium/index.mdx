# Synthetic test with Selenium IDE script

Instana Synthetic monitoring also support synthetic testing using browser script, such as Selenium IDE scripts. 
In this lab exercise, you will learn how to include a pre-defined Selenium IDE script in a synthetic test. 

:::note
Due to the consideration of the lab content and time allocation, we had prepared an earlier recorded Selenium IDE script for use in this lab exercise. This pre-recorded script is a simple script on shopping for robots in Stan's Robot Shop. 
For more advanced and advanced configurations, you may refer to:

Click on the **RobotShopping** link to drill down into the details of the synthetic test.

It will take a couple of minutes for the synthetic tests to begin executing.
