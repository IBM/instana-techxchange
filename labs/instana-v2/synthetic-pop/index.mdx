# Synthetic Monitoring and Action Catalog

This lab focuses on two new Instana features.  The first is synthetic monitoring.  The second is the Action Catalog where you can create and execute automated corrective actions.
Key capabilities that will be exercised are:
- Setting up the synthetic "Point of Presence"  This is the component that executes the synthetic test.
- Single REST API synthetic test
- Using javascript to execute a scripted synthetic test that exercises multiple REST calls
- Create and execute "Actions" via the Action Catalog

Before we can create any synthetic tests, we must first setup a synthetic "Point of Presence" or "PoP server" to playback our synethetic tests.
Many customers deploy two or more "Points of Presence" so that they can compare the response time and availability from different network zones.
For example, if a PoP server running in the LAN network performs well, but a PoP server located on a WAN network is performing poorly, it is clear indication that the problem is the network or load balancer rather than the application.

In the lab, we will begin by installing the "Synethetic Point of Presence".

## 1. Install Synthetic Point of Presence component

1.1 We will be installing the Synthetic Point of Presence into the OpenShift (OCP) cluster.   In order to do that, we'll need access to a CLI will access to the OCP cluster.

From the student VM, open a terminal window and type"

```sh
ssh root@bastion
```

When prompted, enter the password for the Bastion node.

Make sure you are logged into the OCP cluster by typing "oclogin"

In addition, some features must be enabled in the Instana server in order for you to use the synthetic features.  Follow the steps below to enable the synthetics feature within the Instana server.


Change projects to the "instana-core" namespace and edit core component of Instana backend cluster by commands:
```bash
oc project instana-core
oc edit core
```

1.2 Add the following 5 feature flags into the existing spec -> featureFlags section to enable Synthetics features:
```yaml
spec:
  featureFlags:
  - enabled: true
    name: feature.synthetics.enabled
  - enabled: true
    name: feature.synthetic.smart.alerts.enabled
  - enabled: true
    name: feature.synthetic.create.test.advance.mode.enabled
  - enabled: true
    name: feature.synthetic.browser.create.test.enabled
  - enabled: true
    name: feature.synthetic.browser.script.enabled
```

You can copy/paste the yaml from the lab guide into the the Instana "core" object as seen below.

![](images/pasteFeature.png)

Pay attention to indentation since this is yaml.  All entries must be indented by 0, 2, 4, 6 spaces, etc.
Save and exit by typing:

```sh
:wq
```


1.3 Ensure synthetic pods have started sucessfully:
```text
[root@localhost ~]# oc get pods | grep synthetic
synthetics-acceptor-558ff84bbb-g2wxq           1/1     Running   0          5m
synthetics-health-processor-5c8c8c57fb-5fwvb   1/1     Running   0          5m
synthetics-reader-5f59b6df4f-8kn9r             1/1     Running   0          5m
synthetics-writer-579d5cf458-7tx7q             1/1     Running   0          5m
[root@localhost ~]# 
```

At this point, the Instana server is capable of running and displaying synthetic tests, but you still need to setup the "Synthetic Point of Presence".

1.4 If Helm wasn't installed during previous labs, install it on bastion node now with command:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

1.5 Click on "Synthetic Monitoring" and then on "Deploy a PoP" button:
![](images/DeployAPoP.png)

Use "Simple" tab for Helm command. 

You will need to edit the information contained in the helm command, so copy and paste the text into a temporary file.

The default helm command will look as follows.  Some of the parameters have been replace with "xxx" for security reasons.
```sh
helm install synthetic-pop \
	--repo "https://agents.instana.io/helm" \
	--namespace <namespace> \
	--create-namespace \
	--set downloadKey="xxx" \
	--set controller.location="<yourLocationName>;<yourLocationDisplayName>;<yourLocationCountry>;<yourLocationCity>;0;0;<yourLocationDescription>" \
	--set controller.clusterName="<yourClusterName>" \
	--set controller.instanaKey="xxx" \
	--set controller.instanaSyntheticEndpoint="https://xxx" \
	--set redis.tls.enabled=false \
	--set redis.password="<yourPassword>" \
	synthetic-pop
  ```

For Synthetic Point of Presence we need to modify some of the parameters and provide one additional parameter.  

- ***Add `--set seccompDefault=true \`***.  This parameter is required for OpenShift versions 4.11 and above
- Then, modify the **controller.clusterName** parameter and provide a meaningful name.
- In the **controller.location**, specify a name, display name, country, etc. for your "Point of Presence".   The "0;0" parameter represents the longituded and latitude of the "Point of Presence".  These parameters help identify the Point of Presence when  there multiples deployed.
- Finally, enter a redis password.  This can be any value since you are setting the password.

The helm chart should lnow ook similar the following:

```text
helm install synthetic-pop \
     --repo https://agents.instana.io/helm  \
     --namespace instana-synthetic \
     --create-namespace \
    --set downloadKey="xxx" \
     --set controller.location="Local;on Instana cluster;Serbia;Belgrade;39.54;116.23;A test Synthetic Point of Presence" \
     --set controller.instanaKey="xxx" \
     --set controller.clusterName="MyInstanaCluster" \
     --set controller.instanaSyntheticEndpoint="https://xxx/synthetics" \
     --set redis.tls.enabled=false \
     --set redis.password="a1fc5d01bcbb" \
     --set seccompDefault=true \
     synthetic-pop
```

Copy the helm command from the text file and paste it into a terminal window on the Bastion node.  This will execute the helm chart.

You should see an output similar to the following:

```sh
[sysadmin@bastion ~]$ helm install synthetic-pop \
>     --repo https://agents.instana.io/helm  \
>     --namespace instana-synthetic \
>     --create-namespace \
>     --set downloadKey="xxx" \
>     --set controller.location="Local;on Instana cluster;Serbia;Belgrade;39.54;116.23;A test Synthetic Point of Presence" \
>     --set controller.instanaKey="xxx" \
>     --set controller.clusterName="MyInstanaCluster" \
>     --set controller.instanaSyntheticEndpoint="https://xxx/synthetics" \
>     --set redis.tls.enabled=false \
>     --set redis.password="a1fc5d01bcbb" \
>     --set seccompDefault=true \
>     synthetic-pop
NAME: synthetic-pop
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Jul 13 07:49:37 2023
NAMESPACE: instana-synthetic
STATUS: deployed
```

1.6 After the Synthetic point of presence is installed verify its appearence in the interface:

![](images/PointOfPresence_Location.png)

You can also confirm that the Synthetic Point of Presence is running by typing:
```sh
oc get pods -n instna-synthetic
```
Confirm that the pods are all running.


## 2. REST API Synthetic Tests
In the exercise we will follow creating a test of series of probes and as example will monitor number of managed objects. 

We will interrogate Instana backend as an example of external application.


### 2.1 Simple REST API test
Let's begin by executing a simple REST API test.  This will be a single REST GET request.

Begin by selecting "Synthetics" and then "+ ADD" as seen below.

![](images/addSynthetics.png)

Then, click the **Add Synthetic Test** button.

![](images/addSynthetics2.png)

On the dialog that opens, you will see that you have the option of an **API Simple** test or an **API Script** test.   Leave the default of **API Simple** and click the **Next** button.

![](images/addSynthetics3.png)

A new dialog will open prompting for the REST API **GET** URL.   Enter the following URL:
```sh
http://10.100.1.60:32000/random
```

This could be any REST request. In this case, we are testing the **Random** API call within the **Quote of the Day** application.

Then, select your **Point of Presence** location and click **Next**

![](images/addSynthetics4.png)

The next screen allows you to specify the scheduling interval for your synthetic test.  Drag the time slider to 1 minute.  Then, select **Next**

![](images/scheduling.png)

On the next screen you will give your syntetic test a name and description.  Then, optionally, associate the synthetic test with an application.  In this case, select the checkbox next to the **Quote of the Day** application since we are testing the **Random** API call for the **Quote of the Day ** application.

Finally, click the **Create** button to finish creating your synthetic test.


![](images/testName.png)


At this point, you should see a synthetic test named **Random Quote**.  

![](images/randomQuote.png)

Click on the **Random Quote** link to drill down into the details of the synthetic test.

It will take a couple of minutes for the synthetic tests to begin executing.

On the screen, you can see a summary of the synthetic results.  You can also click on the **Results** tab and see the detailed results of each synthetic test.

![](images/syntheticResults.png)


You have not create a synthetic test against a single REST API.  Next, we will be learning how to create more complex synthetics using javascript.  
The example we will be using will actually be executing against the Instana server.  In order to access the Instana REST APIs, you must first generate an API token.  That will be our next step.,



### 2.2. Creating an API token

Since we will be using the Instana REST APIs to test the availability of Instana backend, we need an API token to request data from Instana server. 
API Tokens are a part of authentication and authorization mechanism, that allows access to certain kinds of data. 
We will create a basic token since the APIs we are planning to use do not require special permissions.

Create token by selecting "Settings" -> "Team Settings" -> "API Token" -> "Add API Token":

![](images/CreateAPIToken.png)

Give it a name:

![](images/SyntheticTestName.png)

You will notice that there are many toggles that allow you to assign additional permissions.   But, we are only accessing REST APIs with read-only permissions that do not require any additional permissions.

You will need to save your REST API Token so that you can use it in the javascript   In order to save the API Token, click on the **eye** icon.

![](images/APIToken.png)

After clicking the **eye** icon, you will see the **API Token** and you'll see an icon that allows you to copy the API Token.  Click on the **copy** icon and see the API Token.
The API Token is now in your clipboard, but it probably makes sense to save it to a file so that you can access it later.

![](images/APIToken2.png)


Click "Save" at the bottom of the page. 


### 2.3. Creating REST API test

Synthetic scripts may include several calls and different types GET/POST/PUT/DELETE in the same test. During the lab we will be doing two GET requests:
- First, we will check if Instana backend as a target application returns success code of **200**
- Next, the script will check the number of currently reporting agents and confirm that it is less than a threshold.

2.3.1 Right click on "Synthetic Monitoring" and open it in a new browser tab:
![](images/SyntheticsInANewTab.png)

2.3.2 To create synthetic test switch to just created browser tab with "Synthetic Monitoring" and click "+ ADD" button on the right bottom corner:

![](images/AddSynthetic.png)

2.3.3 Choose "Add Synthetic Test"

Select "Script API" and click "Next" button:

![](images/SyntheticScript.png)

:::note

Use text editor to paste the code into lab environment and than copy from that text editor to the field to avoid errors in the code while pasting directly to the lab environment and the field at once.
To open text editor: click Activities on the left top corner -> Select 9 dots (Show Applications) -> Choose "Text Editor".

![](images/textEditor.png)
:::

In order to paste content into the VM, select the **send text** icon.  Then, paste in the content and click the **Send Text** button at the bottom of the dialog.

![](images/pasteText.png)


2.3.4 Paste the script into a field as shown below:
```javascript
var assert=require('assert');

// Address that Synthetic PoP will use to access target host to interrogate:
var INSTANA_ADDR = 'https://dev-aiops.apps.ocp.ibm.edu';

// Target system token that allows to serve the request (As soon as we
// interrogate Instana backend, it is Instana token):
var TOKEN = "0GKMs6mpSXqK9WMByM5lbg";

// ======================================================================
// First call
// create Object option with details of request including URI and header:
var options = {
    uri: INSTANA_ADDR+'/api/instana/health',
    strictSSL: false,
    headers: {
                   'Content-type': 'application/json',
                   'Authorization': 'apiToken ' + TOKEN
           }
};

// Send request and check if the response code is 200
$http.get(options, function(error, response, body) {
    var bodyObj = JSON.parse(body);
    assert.ok(response.statusCode==200, "GET status should be 200. Instead it's " + response.statusCode);
});

// ======================================================================
// Second call
// create Object option with details of request including URI and header:
var options = {
    uri: INSTANA_ADDR+'/api/infrastructure-monitoring/monitoring-state',
    strictSSL: false,
    headers: {
                   'Content-type': 'application/json',
                   'Authorization': 'apiToken ' + TOKEN
           }
};

$http.get(options, function(error, response, body) {
    var bodyObj = JSON.parse(body);
    assert.ok(bodyObj.hostCount < 3, "We have license to monitor 2 hosts and we have reached " + bodyObj.hostCount + " already!");
});
```

In the javascript, you will need to replace the API Token shown above (0GKMs6mpSXqK9WMByM5lbg) with the API Token you generated earlier.

As follows:

![](images/Create_Synthetic_Test.png)

2.3.5 For the test we need the Instana token that we created on previous step.  If you didn't save the API Token, you can use the following steps to retrieve the token.
   - Switch to previous browser tab with Tokens: ![](images/TokenEye.png)
   - Click on eye on the right from the token and copy text.
   - Switch back to browser tab with script
   - Paste Token as value for TOKEN variable (line 9 on screenshot above)

2.3.6 Instana will run the script from previously installed Synthetic Point of Presence, they can be placed at multiple locations across available infrastructure. The one we will use is deployed on the same cluster with Instana, it may have different name. Select it for our test.
   
Click Next


2.3.7 Adjust time slider to run test every minute:
![](images/TimeSlider.png)

and click "Next" button.


2.3.8 Give the test meaningful name and description:
![](images/CreateSynthTest.png)

At the dialog under "Select an Application" you may specify the list of existing applications for which the test is relevant. The result of the test will appear at the "Synthetic Monitoring" tab of the Application dashboard and you will be able to filter tests by application on Synthetic Monitoring dashboard.

Click "Create" button.

2.3.9 It may take up to minute for Instana to perform the first test and show the line with results. You can refresh browser window and changing time duration for the dashboard on right top of the window to speed up the line to appear before the results of first test will be processed.

By now you should see a list of tests:
![](images/ListOfTests.png)

2.3.10 Click on the test name to access the dashboard of the synthetic test:

![](images/SyntheticTestDashboard.png)

At the moment we have 2 agents reporting to the backend, so the assert of the last check has been passed. We will adjust threshold of the assert to 1 so we can trigger the synthetic test to fail.

2.3.11 Repeat the creation step 2.3 for additional "Failing test" with the script adjusted as `assert.ok(bodyObj.hostCount < 1,` at the last request instead of `< 4` as below:

```javascript
...
$http.get(options, function(error, response, body) {
    var bodyObj = JSON.parse(body);
    assert.ok(bodyObj.hostCount < 1, "We bought license to monitor 2 hosts and we have reached " + bodyObj.hostCount + " already!");
});
```

Or click "Configuration" tab of a test and edit script to change hostCount condition. 

In the case the result will indicate that the parameter is out of the desired amount (monitored systems number threshold has been reached):

![](images/FailingTest.png)

## 3. Create smart Alert for test

Smart Alerts allow you to identify a threshold violation.   Then, if desired, Alert people via external systems like Watson AIOps or Email, Slack, Service Now, etc. in Instana the notification mechanism is called an **Alert Channel** 

3.1 Click "Synthetic Monitoring" -> "Smart Alerts" -> "ADD SYNTHETIC SMART ALERT":
![](images/AddSmartAlert.png)

Click "Add Synthetic Test" -> checkmark the failing test -> hit button "Add 1 Test"

![](images/SA_Step1.png)

Click "Next"

3.2 You may add filter for monitored objects, click "Next"

![](images/SA_Step2.png)

3.3 We choose 1 consecutive occurrence to fire an alert, click Next:

![](images/SA_Step3.png)

3.4 Select "Select Alert Channels", "Create Alert Channel" to create new channel, then populate name of the channel and the list of email addresses (we will not send emails to real addresses, so just populate the field with any email address):
![](images/SA_Step4_CreateChannel.png)

and click "Create Alert Channel", click "Cancel" to finish channel creation procedure.

Select created channel and click "Add 1 Channel":

![](images/SA_Step4_AddChannel.png)

And click "Next":

![](images/SA_Step4_AlertChannels.png)

3.5 Configure the alert that will be visible when the threshold violated. Set meaningful values for Title, Alert Level and Description, then click "Create" button:

![](images/SA_Step5.png)

Refresh page to have the alert appeared:

![](images/ConfiguredAlert.png)

Check Events appeared:

![](images/Events.png)

## 4. Create Actions

Actions in Instana allow to execute corrective commands in the same operating system with Instana agent. The approach allows to reduce downtime by fixing known issues right from the interface of Instana. 
For example, when the log file of an application consumed all available disk space SREs may restore service by deleteing logs or extending space with one click from Instana dashboard.
In the lab we will create an action that SRE can run from the context of a raised event.

4.1 Click on Automation from the left menu, select "Action catalog" and then "New Action"
![](images/ActionCatalog_new.png)

Define Name and Description:
![](images/ActionCatalog_ActionDetails.png)

Select "Script" and populate command to execute:
![](images/ActionCatalog_ActionConfiguration.png)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo `date` " - Deleting old log files" >> /tmp/action.txt
```

4.2 At "4. Associate Events" section click on "Select Events" and choose "Erroneous call rate too high" events to associate with the action:
![](images/ActionCatalog_AssociateEvents.png)
Scroll down and click "Add 3 Events", 
Scroll down and click "Create"

4.3 Now we need to allow "Actions" on agents by enabling plugin in `configuration.yaml` of the agent.
Login to Infranfs node using ssh terminal as root.
Edit configuration.yaml of the agent:
```bash
vi /opt/instana/agent/etc/instana/configuration.yaml
```

Enable Actions plugin by adding the following config block in the end of the file:
```yml
# Action Catalog
com.instana.plugin.action:
  enable: true    # by default is false
com.instana.plugin.action.script:
  enable: true    # by default is false
  scriptExecutionHome: /tmp
  runAs: mqm
```

Save end exit from file.

4.4 Get back to Instana dashboard and open Events -> Issues:
Choose issue "Erroneous call rate too high":
![](images/ActionCatalog_Event.png)

Scroll down, see associated actions with the event and click "Run" on the Associated Action "Delete old log files":
![](images/ActionCatalog_RunAction.png)

Select Agent on which to run the command and click "Run Action":
![](images/ActionCatalog_SelectAgent.png)

4.4 To ensure the script has been executed login to Infranfs node using ssh terminal as root.

Check content of a file `/tmp/action.txt` on infranfs:

```bash
cat /tmp/action.txt
```

Check that the script has been executed successfully:
![](images/ActionCatalog_Results.png)


## Summary

During the lab we:
- Configured target monitored system (created Token to request parameters)
- Created Synthetic test with script to call REST endpoint
- Created Smart Alert for the test
- Created Action and run it from the context of Event
