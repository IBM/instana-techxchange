# Smart Alert for Synthetic Test

## Creating Smart Alert for a synthetic test

In this lab, we will be creating Smart Alert to detect a problem with a synthetic test, and notify the team(s) of the problem via the **Alert Channel**. 

Click "Synthetic Monitoring" -> "Add"

You may optionally add filters to define the scope of what is being monitored. In this case, we will not be adding any filters.  Simply click "Next".

We choose 1 consecutive occurrence to fire an alert, click Next:

In the next step, we will be selecting an Alert Channel.  Alert Channels allow you to notify people and teams via various **channels** such as email, slack, ServiceNow, etc.

Select "Select Alert Channels"

Then select "Create Alert Channel" to create a new alert channel.

Provide a name for the channel and the list of email addresses (we will not send emails in this lab, so just populate the field with any email address):

Select the newly created alert channel and click "Add 1 Channel":

Next, we configure the alert that will be visible when the threshold is violated. Set meaningful values for Title, Alert Level and Description, then click "Create" button:

Refresh the page to show the just configured alert to appear in the **Smart Alerts** tab.

After a few moments, you can click on **Event** to see the new event appearing.

When the new event alert triggered on the synthetic test failure, an e-mail will be sent out via the **Alert Channel** notifying the people of the failure.
:::note
Email will NOT be sent out in this lab due to networking limitation

In summary, you have now setup a Smart Alert that will trigger when a synthetic test fails, and a notification will be send out via an email alert channel.
