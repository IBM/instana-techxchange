# Synthetic Monitoring and Action Catalog

This lab focuses on two new Instana features.  The first is synthetic monitoring.  The second is the Action Catalog where you can create and execute automated corrective actions.
Key capabilities that will be exercised are:
- Setting up the synthetic "Point of Presence"  This is the component that executes the synthetic test.
- Single REST API synthetic test
- Using javascript to execute a scripted synthetic test that exercises multiple REST calls
- Synthetic test using a simple Selenium IDE script
- Setup Smart Alerts against synthetic tests
- Create and execute "Actions" via the Action Catalog

Before we can create any synthetic tests, we must first setup a synthetic "Point of Presence" or "PoP server" to playback our synethetic tests.
Many customers deploy two or more "Points of Presence" so that they can compare the response time and availability from different network zones.
For example, if a PoP server running in the LAN network performs well, but a PoP server located on a WAN network is performing poorly, it is clear indication that the problem is the network or load balancer rather than the application.

In the lab, we will begin by installing the "Synethetic Point of Presence".
